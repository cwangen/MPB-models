# MPB-models
MATLAB code for the mountain pine beetle (MPB) oviposition model and phenology model developed during my MS thesis and published in the Journal for Mathematical Biology. The oviposition model for a southern MPB population is expressed as a MATLAB function in ovipos.m, and the complete phenology model (which incorporates the oviposition model) can be found in the MATLAB function vfpredmodel.m.
